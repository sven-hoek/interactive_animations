The basic principle is similar to the rope from the previous post. Both ends are now connected and an additional area constraint is being applied.

Touch the screen or move the mouse around to start and interact. Note that scrolling with a touchscreen requires to touch ouside the canvas area.
The simulation bases on simple distance constraints and Verlet integration.

Inspired by [Sublucid Geometry's blog post](https://zalo.github.io/blog/constraints/), which has a little more info.
