# Interactive Animations

Click here to try it out and get more info: [https://sven-hoek.github.io/](https://sven-hoek.github.io/). Otherwise, you can simply clone/download the repo and open `index.html` in a browser.

Mainly some examples to learn JavaScript and simulation/interactive animation. So far everything written in plain JavaScript, using the canvas.

Partly inspired by [Sublucid Geometry's Blog Entry](https://zalo.github.io/blog/constraints/) and [argonaut's videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlfh_rv6khY).
